# Professional Profile


  <img style="width:20%; height:30%; float:left" src="/assets/images/headshot.jpg">
  Technical Writer with 6+ years of experience in technical writing. My previous roles were focused in the supply chain and logistics sector with a focus on Mechanical and Electrical work instructions, User Guides, and Software.
  
  In my most recent role, I was responsible for architecting and documenting an IT Service structure for an in-house logisitics software. This required me to become familiar with SAP and the software interface to be able to develop user guides and set up a service structure that accurately supported end users in the field. I was instrumental in identifying key users in the field and collaborating with them to develop a structure that was user friendly.
  
 I am experienced in DITA, XML, HTML, CSS, and React. I have experience using APIs and understand the REST architecture for web development purposes. Further than that, I am skilled in information architecture and working with SMEs to develop accurate user stories to support end users.
